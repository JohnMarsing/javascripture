		<h2>Features</h2>
		<p>This is a list of the main features of Javascripture with some explanation and context</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Offline</strong><br/>
				Javascripture should work offline if your brower supports it. It uses a service worker which has <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=serviceworkers">pretty good support</a> these days.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Word tree</strong><br />
				Strongs dictionary defines roots for each word. Javascripture uses this data to also create "branches" for each word too. A branch is a word which has the current word as its root. This makes it easier to find related words.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Hovering</strong></br>
				When you hover over a word, all the other words with the same strongs number are highlighted.
			</li>
		</ul>
